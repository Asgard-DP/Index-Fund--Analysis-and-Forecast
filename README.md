# Project-1

You have the following two options for your project:

Develop a financial application.

Analyze a financial problem.

The first option will take the form of a fully-fledged application that real users could use. The second option is more analytical, with the goal of better understanding data and/or patterns. This may take the form of an elaborate Jupyter notebook, or a set of them. You may also include elements of both options in your project.



A portfolio analyzer: Build an app that compares the performance of Index Fund portfolios that are composed of different assets and BTC. Include calculations, tables, financial models, and Monte Carlo simulations. Also include information about past and future performance of the portfolios, as well as suggestions for improving that performance.

XLK had the best retusn in entire 5 year [eriod ending at a 97% growth . Though BTC showed higher total returns reaching an increase of 370%, it showed to be a risky investment ovet time as it only ended at 24% growth in all past 5 years. This is further supported by the Sharpe- ratio , XLK sector had a sharpe ratio over .5 at 0.62 This was alsmot tripple over the comparable index funds XLF and XLRE , which do show sighns of a possitive correlation.
